                <p>I'm a product-minded software engineer and web developer living in London.
                    I've recently graduated from <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UCL</a> through the <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/smart-cities-urban-analytics-msc" target="_blank">urban analytics</a> MSc programme and I've previously graduated from the <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Sheffield</a> with a Bachelor of Engineering.
                    Through both of my degree programmes, I have curated a range of interdisciplinary technical skills and a passion for front-end development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an engineer, I am motivated to understand and solve problems â€” combining my technical know-how with innovative methods to produce an elegant software solution.
                     My goal is to build applications that are efficient and scalable, and I aspire to a career that will allow me to craft engaging user-centric products.
                </p>

                <p>Aside from programming, I am an amateur producer, coffee aficionado, fitness lover, aspiring writer, and I love to skii!</p>
